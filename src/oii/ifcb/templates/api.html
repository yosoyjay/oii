<h1>IFCB web services API</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

IFCB web services provide access to IFCB data, imagery, and metadata in various raw and standard formats.
You can use these web services to access IFCB data from anywhere, and discover what data is in an IFCB time series.

<p>

All IFCB API URLs are prefixed with a namespace URL that identifies the time series being accessed.
For example, the MVCO time series is at this URL prefix:

<div class="api code">
http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco
</div>

IFCB data is partitioned into sample bins which typically represent about 20 minutes worth of imaging flow cytometry on
a single seawater sample. The data in each sample bin is organized into targets, and some of the targets have associated
image data.

<p>

Each bin has a URL. Bin URLs are available from the <a href='#feedapi'>feed API</a> described below. A bin URL begins with
the namespace URL, followed by a code identifying the bin.

<a name="feedapi"></a>
<h2>Feed API</h2>

Feeds of most recent data are available in standard formats. The following URLs return a list of the most recent
bins up to the current time:

<div class="api code">
<i>namespace</i>/feed.rss<br>
<i>namespace</i>/feed.html<br>
<i>namespace</i>/feed.atom<br>
<i>namespace</i>/feed.json<br>
</div>

To constrain the feed to an earlier date, use this variant:

<div class="api code">
<i>namespace</i>/api/feed/date/<i>date</i>/format/<i>format</i><br>
</div>

Where "date" is an ISO8601 compliant timestamp (e.g., 2007-04-05) and "format" is one of rss, html, atom, and json.
<p>

To list all sample bins in a date range, use this variant
<div class="api code">
<i>namespace</i>/api/feed/start/<i>date</i>/end/<i>date</i>/format/<i>format</i><br>
</div>

<h2>Sample bin API</h2>

Raw data is available for each sample bin at the following endpoints:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>.hdr<br>
<i>bin URL</i>.adc<br>
<i>bin URL</i>.roi<br>
</div>

These URLs return raw IFCB data. It is not in any standard format, although ADC data is in CSV syntax.
<p>

XML, RDF, JSON, and CSV variants are available by using the appropriate prefixes:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>.xml<br>
<i>bin URL</i>.rdf<br>
<i>bin URL</i>.csv<br>
<i>bin URL</i>.json<br>
</div>

These variants provide metadata from the sample bin's header file as well as a list of target URLs, which can be used
with the target API.

<div class="api">
<b>RAW DATA CONTAINS "EXTRA" TARGETS:</b>
Raw IFCB data for a sample bin almost always contains more targets than will appear in metadata returned from the
XML, RDF, CSV and JSON URLs. This is for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Some targets in an ADC file have no image associated with them. In the ADC file these will have a (width,height) of (0,0).
These targets are skipped for URLs other than <i>bin URL</i>.adc.</li>
<li>In early IFCB models, some pairs of images associated with the same trigger overlap. In this case the web services
will return a composited target at the URL of the first target of the pair, and will report that the second target
of the pair does not exist.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
A ZIP endpoint returns image data along with metadata, in zip format. Note that this is a CPU-intensive
call that can take as long as 30 seconds to complete for a large sample bin.

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>.zip
</div>

To see an interactive web page summarizing the sample bin, use this URL:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>.html<br>
</div>

<h2>Target API</h2>

Once a target URL is in hand, metadata about it can be fetched in a variety of standard formats:

<div class="api code">
<i>target URL</i>.xml<br>
<i>target URL</i>.rdf<br>
<i>target URL</i>.json<br>
</div>

Images can be fetched using image extensions;

<div class="api code">
<i>target URL</i>.png<br>
<i>target URL</i>.tiff<br>
<i>target URL</i>.jpg<br>
<i>target URL</i>.gif<br>
<i>target URL</i>.bmp<br>
</div>

The PNG and TIFF variants are guaranteed to contain the exact data in the image. Other formats may
be lossy. In particular do not use the JPG variant if you intend to perform any automated analysis
of the images.

<div class="api">
<b>IMAGE DIMENSIONS ARE ROTATED:</b>
The image dimensions given in image metadata are 90 degrees rotated from the coordinate systems of the images
returned by the image endpoints. So the field called "width" in target metadata corresponds to the height
of the image returned from the target image URLs, and the field called "height" corresponds to the width
of the image returned from the target image URLs.</div>

To see an interactive web page summarizing the sample bin, use this URL:

<div class="api code">
<i>target URL</i>.html<br>
</div>

<h2>Product API: Sample Bins</h2>

In addition to instrument data and images, image processing, features, and classification results
are also available.

To fetch a ZIP file containing all "blobs" (bitmap masks separating the target from the background)
for a given bin, use one of these URL variants:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>_blob.zip<br>
<i>namespace</i>/api/blob/pid/<i>bin URL</i>.zip<br>
</div>

Note that in the second variant you should put the entire bin URL after <tt>/pid/</tt>. The URL should look like this:

<div class="api code">
http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco/api/blob/pid/http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco/IFCB1_2009_208_123123.zip
</div>

Instead of this:

<div class="api code">
http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco/api/blob/pid/IFCB1_2009_208_123123.zip
</div>

Features (scalar metrics computed from images and metadata prior to classification) are available in
CSV format using one of these URL variants:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>_features.csv<br>
<i>namespace</i>/api/features/pid/<i>bin URL</i>.csv<br>
</div>

And classification results are available using one of these URL variants:

<div class="api code">
<i>bin URL</i>_class_scores.csv<br>
<i>namespace</i>/api/class_scores/pid/<i>bin URL</i>.csv<br>
</div>

Note that products are not available unless the processing that produces them has completed.

<h2>Product API: Targets</h2>

Blob images are available per-target. Use one of these URL variants:

<div class="api code">
<i>target URL</i>_blob.<i>extension</i><br>
<i>namespace</i>/api/blob/pid/<i>target URL</i>.<i>extension</i><br>
</div>

Where <i>extension</i> is a valid image type extension such as "png".

A simple visualization that shows the outline of the blob overlaid on the target image is available at:

<div class="api code">
<i>target URL</i>_blob_outline.<i>extension</i><br>
</div>

Note that blob outlining requires some image processing on the server side.

</div>
