- fixed method changeItem not dealing with changing the type of the item
  from box to range or vice versa.


2012-07-27, version 2.2.0

- added an option showMinorLabels. By setting both showMinorLabels and

- fixed issue #6: items and axis did not move with the speed when moving
  the Timeline under IE8 and older.
