Illumination Correction at-sea impl 2013

All code is in /home/habcam/ic

The 10-minute bin to use as a lightmap is specified in /home/habcam/ic/learn_bin.conf

The bin is specified on a line by itself, with nothing else in the file. For example:

START OF learn_bin.conf
20130603_1820
END OF learn_bin.conf

It is critical that this be in the correct format of YYYYMMDD_HHM0.

If a lightmap does not exist for the specified bin it will be created.

Lightfield processing will produce output for all bins after the one specified in /home/habcam/ic/start_bin.conf

The bin is specified on a line by itself, with nothing else in the file. For example:

START OF start_bin.conf
20130603_1850
END OF start_bin.conf

Lightfield correction runs continuously and processes all images that have not yet been processed.

All output is deposited in /habcam/nmfs/proc in the appropriate subdirectory structure.

For example the output for 20130603_1820 is located at

/habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820

RGB stereo pairs are written to the {bin_lid}_rgb_illum_LR subdirectory, for example

/habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820/20130603_1820_rgb_illum_LR

if you want to reprocess images (they were not processed with the desired lightmap, etc) simpoly
delete the output directory, for example /habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820.

Be very careful when deleting processed images. DO NOT DELETE RAW IMAGES BY MISTAKE!!!!!

Logs are written to /habcam/nmfs/proc/logs. There will be multiple logs per bin representing
every attempt to process images, and most of them will simply indicate that the bin was skipped.
Very small ones will be automatically deleted to save space. Especially long ones are the
interesting ones as they are a record of processing.

Logs are compressed and can be decompressed with gunzip.

Configuration of the lightfield workflow is in lightfield_config.py. BE VERY CAREFUL editing this
file as syntax errors will halt processing, and parameter changes may have dramatic effects on
performance and quality of output. Some important parameters in that file include:

SCRATCH - location of output. do not change this as it will cause all images to be reprocessed.
CALIBRATION_DIR - location of camera calibration.

NUM_LEARN - number of images to use when producing a lightmap. raising this value can prevent
 completely or partially blackened output images, but will increase the time required to create
 a lightmap
NUM_CORRECT - number of images to process per bin - set this as high as you want
NUM_PROCS - number of processes to use for multiprocessing. leave this at 12 = number of CPUs
NUM_THREADS - number of threads to use when correcting. leave this at 24 = number of hardware threads

IMAGELIST_STEP - set to 2 to process every other image, 3 for every third, etc. applies to
 both building the lightmap and processing images

DEFAULT_IC_CONFIG - some parameters for the Rock/Honig algorithm. Do not change.

Important files:

/home/habcam/ic/learn_bin.conf - file containing ID of bin to compute/use lightmap from
/home/habcam/ic/start_bin.conf - file containing ID of bin, will not process this bin or earlier bins
/home/habcam/ic/lightfield_config.py - lightfield workflow parameters

/home/habcam/ic/cron.sh - called by cron every five minutes to keep process running
/home/habcam/ic/doitall.sh - called by cron.sh to process all unprocessed data
/home/habcam/ic/oii/scripts/nosplit_lightfield_batch.py - workflow batch script that does the work
/home/habcam/ic/oii/scripts/habcam_atsea.xml - resolver that finds data and configures paths

/habcam/nmfs/proc - all processed images and lightmaps live here
/habcam/nmfs/proc/logs - all logs live here

In each processed directory:

{bin ID}_cfa_illum_LR - corrected RAW 16-bit stereo pairs
{bin ID}_rgb_illum_LR - corrected RGB 8-bit/channel stereo pairs
{bin ID}_alt.csv - altitudes computed from parallax
