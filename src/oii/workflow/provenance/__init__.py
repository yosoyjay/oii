'''
Provenance tracking API.
The basic model is that of the Open Provenance Model.
A provenance record states that a product was produced from 0 or more inputs via some process.
That process has metadata describing what kind of processing ran, when it ran, and
its completion / success status.
All input and output datasets must have permanent, globally-unique IDs.
Each process has an ID too.
A process cannot be re-run or re-started. That counts as a new process.

NEW='new' # never attempted
PENDING='pending' # starting
RUNNING='running' # in process
SUCCEEDED='succeeded' # completed, succeeded
FAILED='failed' # completed, failed
BLACKLISTED='blacklisted' # this should not be attempted again
SKIPPED='skipped' # this was skipped for some reason but could be re-attempted
